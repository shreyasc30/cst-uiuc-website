                        Meet the brothers of Chi Sigma Tauâ€™s Gamma Chapter, here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
                        All of our brothers come from several unique walks of lives and bring a lot of different personalities to the brotherhood.
                        Yet at the same time, we are all unified by the same goal: improving ourselves and the fraternity.
                        Each of our brothers contributes to the fraternity in different ways by holding different positions.
                        Find out a little more about our active brothers and the positions they hold in the fraternity, and all the brothers in our chapter through the years!
