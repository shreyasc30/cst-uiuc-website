                                Chi Sigma Tau National Fraternity, Inc. is the first Asian American interest fraternity to have been founded in the Midwest.
                                Currently we have 6 chapters established across the Midwest, and the Gamma chapter of Chi Sigma Tau was founded at the University of Illinois of Urbana-Champaign on December 3, 2006.
                                Chi Sigma Tau has been dedicated to bringing the best of high school athletes and scholars together to create an elite organization.
                                Today CST can boast of Marines, MMA fighters, top high school athletes, rappers, dancers, DJ's, and most importantly, successful college graduates. Although CST is an Asian interest organization, it is NOT Asian Exclusive.
                                We welcome men of all backgrounds to join in a TRUE Brotherhood. Chi Sigma Tau takes young students and guides them to graduation and their future-- As prepared, well rounded gentlemen.

                                Chi Sigma Tau is focused on developing leaders and bringing Asian-American awareness to the community.
                                We are also focused on our charity of choice, Alzheimer's Association- Greater Illinois Chapter.
                                We work closely with a representative from Bloomington to coordinate events and workshops here on campus.
                                The Alzheimerâ€™s Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer care, support and research.
                                We regularly conduct workshops with Alzheimer's Association and their representative to teach people how to interact with those affected by Alzheimer's, and help organize and volunteer at the annual "Walk for Alzheimer's" event to raise awareness and money for the cause.
